`IO Ninja <http://ioninja.com>`_ is a professional, scriptable, multi-purpose terminal emulator, network sniffer, and IO monitor.

It is aimed at network security experts, system administrators, and all kinds of software/hardware/embedded developers.

Most of the IO Ninja source code is *open-source* and some of it already is hosted on GitHub (e.g., the `Jancy <https://github.com/vovkos/jancy>`_ programming language). On the other hand, a portion of the codebase is *proprietary* and as such cannot be hosted in public GitHub repos.

This issues-only repo ``ioninja-issues`` is a *public issue tracker*. Use it to conveniently report bugs in IO Ninja, create feature requests and discuss further improvements. All that's needed is a GitHub account -- log in to GitHub and start creating `new issues <https://github.com/vovkos/ioninja-issues/issues/new>`_.
